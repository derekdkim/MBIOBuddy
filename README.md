## Note: This application is current in development.

Academic writing is never easy and formatting manuscripts when you just spent unspeakable hours writing is always an annoyance.

This tool provides a technological solution to laborious formatting tasks such as checking for italics to adhere to proper nomenclature, as well as other minor but nifty quality of life features.
